## API

This API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Unless otherwise specified, API endpoints accept [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, return JSON-encoded responses, and use standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Content Type

Unless otherwise specified, all requests must be encoded as JSON with the \`Content-Type: application/json\` header. Unless otherwise specified, responses from the API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

## Authentication

### API Key

Optional API key for authenticated access. Note that we use "auth token" and "API key" interchangably in these docs.

Unauthenticated (public) requests are subject to rate limiting. See [pricing](/pricing) for specifics on these rate limits.

Authenticated requests must include an \`Authorization\` header containing your subscription's auth token.

| Security Schema Type | Header Name | Example Token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Key | \`Authorization\` | aebfbb4729a300da7cc5c470 |

In the following example, \`TOKEN\` represents the auth token for your account.

\`\`\`
curl --header 'authorization: TOKEN'
\`\`\`

You can view and manage your auth tokens in the [Dashboard](/dashboard).

Be sure to keep your auth tokens secure. Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Also note that all API requests must be made over **HTTPS**. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.

## Rate Limits

With the public, non-authenticated version of the API, we limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time. Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| \`X-RateLimit-Limit\` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make. |
| \`X-RateLimit-Remaining\` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |
| \`X-RateLimit-Reset\` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |

When the rate limit is **exceeded**, an error is returned with the status "**429 Too Many Requests**":

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "too_many_requests",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Errors

This API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. In general: Codes in the \`2xx\` range indicate success. Codes in the \`4xx\` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, endpoint not found, etc.). Codes in the \`5xx\` range indicate an error with our API (these are rare).

## Versioning

API versions are **immutable** which guarantees that once you have a working integration, it will always be completely optional to upgrade to newer versions.

When we make backwards-incompatible changes to an API, we release new versions following [semver](https://semver.org/). The current version is \`${version}\`.

You can visit your [Dashboard](/dashboard) to manage your API version.
